Under the entry is a detailed drawing of a paranoid, wild-
 eyed man huddled in the corner of a damp basement lit by a
 bare bulb on a cord. Joel notices something odd a great
 many pages have been torn out after the last entry. He
 ponders it for a moment, then writes on the next page:
It's a local tourist place, but off-season empty. An old
 couple drink coffee at the counter. Joel sits in a booth and
 eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of tomato soup. In
 his notebook he is drawing a wizened old man with a metal
 detector. His metal detector has led him to another dead old
 man clutching a metal detector. Joel meekly, unsuccessfully,
 tries to get the waitress's attention for more coffee.
 Clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood. Joel
 glances at her bright blue hair. She picks an empty booth
 and sits. Joel studies her discreetly. The waitress
 approaches her with a coffee pot. : 
Joel stares out at the ocean. Far down the beach Clementine
 stares at it, too. Joel glances sideways at her then back at
 the ocean. :
Clementine pulls a book from her purse and starts to read.
 Joel glances up, tries to see the book's cover. It's blue
 and white. He can't make out the title. :
It's dark out. The train is pretty crowded. A couple of
 women hold bouquets of flowers, another has a red heart-
 shaped box of candy. Joel stares out the window. Clementine
 sits closer still to Joel, eyes him.
