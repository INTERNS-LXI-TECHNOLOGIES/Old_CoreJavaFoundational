Lifetime Exec Platinum status. You
get to meet the Chief Pilot,
Maynard Finch. And... They put your

Men get such a hard-on from putting
their name on stuff... You guys
don’t grow up - You just need to
pee on everything.:
Now, who’s stereotyping?:
Fear of mortality. It’s like Yes,
you’re going to die one day.:
And why do you suppose that’s singular
to men?
